# Python Admin Dashboard

## Project Description

This Python Admin Dashboard is inspired by a comprehensive React Admin Dashboard tutorial [Build and Deploy a React Admin Dashboard App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5hdo50a2M). The dashboard includes features such as theming, tables, charts, a calendar, a Kanban board, and more, implemented in Python using libraries like Dash or Streamlit.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a dynamic and feature-rich admin dashboard that can be used for monitoring, reporting, or as a control panel for various applications.

## Project Goals

- **Learning and Skill Development**: Enhance understanding of Python in web applications, integrating front-end technologies and mastering libraries like Dash or Streamlit.
- **Feature-Rich Interface**: Build a functional and interactive dashboard, showcasing Python's capability for dynamic user interactions and complex functionalities.
- **Data Visualization**: Improve skills in data presentation with interactive charts and graphs using libraries like Plotly.
- **User Experience**: Design a user-friendly interface that simplifies data and task management for all users.
- **Modularity and Scalability**: Ensure the dashboard is easy to update and extend, with well-organized, modular code.
- **Real-World Application**: Develop a tool suitable for various professional environments, serving as a template for future projects.
- **Community Contribution**: Encourage community collaboration to enhance the project with diverse ideas and feedback.

## Features

- **Theming**: Customize the appearance according to user preferences or corporate identity.
- **Tables**: Display and manage data efficiently.
- **Charts**: Visualize data with various chart types.
- **Calendar**: Manage and schedule events.
- **Kanban Board**: Organize tasks and projects.

## Built With

- Python 3.x
- Dash or Streamlit (TBD)
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Plotly for creating interactive charts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-admin-dashboard.git


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
